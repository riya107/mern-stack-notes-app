which uses nodejs and express in backend. MongoDB is used as a Database. 

Features of the app:

Different people can make their own account and can get access to their own notes only.

Each Individual can manage his/her notes only.

Everyone can add new notes, delete a note or update the existing note.

all the actions like add note, update note and delete note etc. are handled in the backend using the router.

Validations are also used so that no one can send wrong information in the database.
